## Usage
Upon clicking the start button, the timer in the upper righthand corner will begin counting down and the first question will be displayed. Each correct answer will add 10 seconds and each incorrect answer will subtract 10 seconds. The final score is the time remaining upon completion of the quiz. If the time runs out before the quiz is complete, the score is zero. Upon completion of the quiz, the user can input their name or initials to add their score to the high scores list. The high scores can be seen by clicking the view high scores link in the upper lefthand corner. From the high scores page, the user can return to the homepage or clear the stored high scores.

## Features
This application utilizes local storage to store and view high scores at a later date. Upon completing the quiz, an event listener is triggered when the user submits their score and name or initials. The name/score pair is added to an array containing the existing items from local storage and sorted into it's appropriate ranking. That new array is then set to replace the one currently in local storage. When the view high scores page is opened, the new array content from local storage can now be added to an html ordered list for viewing.
